<h1>Hi, I'm Joby!</h1>

<p>
  I'm an artist, a graphic designer, and at my day job I'm a full stack web developer.
  Right now I work mostly in PHP, but I'm really a Swiss Army knife of a person (I went to art school
  <em>and</em>
  computer science school), and I can pick up most programming languages pretty quick.
</p>

<p>
  I like my job a lot, so I'm really only in the job market for straight up dream-job type stuff.
