<h1>Hi, I'm Joby!</h1>

<p>
  I'm an artist, a graphic designer, and at my day job I'm a full stack web developer.
  Right now I work mostly in PHP, and my previous professional experience was in ASP.NET, but I'm a Swiss Army knife of a person (I went to art school
  <em>and</em>
  computer science school). I pick up new programming languages quickly and poking around in new-to-me codebases is kinda my forte.
</p>

<p>
  I like my job a lot, so I'm really only in the job market for outright dream-job situations.
