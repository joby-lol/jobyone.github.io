title: HTML Object Strings

This one's pretty nascent at the moment, but I'm building a PHP library to build and manipulate HTML nodes, tags, fragments, and whole documents.

The idea is to have a completely integrated and extensible system for managing building/parsing, manipulating, and rendering HTML.
