title: DNS soup
---

All my old comments on this blog are gone, and my websites are split across both byjoby.com and byjoby.net now. What to do about it? The comments are just gone, such is the price I pay for moving my domain when I had been using G+ comments.

Now to finish sorting out my crazy web of DNS records. I own six domain names (SIX!) that are split across two different registrars, one of which isn't a host. I host my sites on a crazy combination of one proper web host, Blogger, and a home Linux server (which is broken at the moment, I might add, because hard drives love to turn up the suck).

Not that anybody cares, just figured I'd throw out the reason some of the links around my web presence are squirrely (and probably will continue to be for the next 24 hours or so).

A word to the wise: If you want a website, and are just some random citizen -- do yourself a favor. Just get one host that's also your registrar, and keep everything on that one domain name with a sane url pattern. Boom, done, you've now halved your headaches for the next few years.

If you're looking for a host, I can't recommend A Small Orange enough. They're very affordable, have a huge number of plans so you can scale up more smoothly than most hosts, and I've been super-impressed with their technical support to boot (on the precisely two occasions when I've needed it).
